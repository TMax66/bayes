<p>Diagnostic Bayes Calculator is an interactive shiny app that allows to calculate the posterior probability of the result of a qualitative diagnostic test.&nbsp;<br />It's very easy to use it. You have to know three input values:&nbsp;<br />- The Pretest probability of disease&nbsp;<br />-The Diagnostic test Sensitivity&nbsp;<br />-The Diagnostic test Specificity&nbsp;<br /><br />Knowing Bayes' theorem is not so necessary but knowing it can not hurt you.&nbsp;<br />So for an introduction, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes' theorem</a>&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Pretest probability of Disease</h3>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cebm.net/">CEBM</a>&nbsp;Pretest probability of disease is: the probability of a patient having the target disorder before a diagnostic test result is known. It represents the probability that a specific patient, say a middle-aged man, with a specific past history, say hypertension and cigarette smoking, who presents to a specific clinical setting, like Accident and Emergency, with a specific symptom complex, say retrosternal chest pressure, dyspnoea and diaphoresis, has a specific diagnosis, such as acute myocardial infarction.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Test Sensitivity (Se)</h3>
<p>The sensitivity of a clinical test refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify those patients with the disease.</p>
<h3>Test Specificity (Sp)</h3>
<p>The specificity of a clinical test refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify those patients without the disease.</p>
<p>You can find&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity">here</a>&nbsp;a very simple explanation of Se and Sp</p>
<h3>Likelihood Ratio (LR)</h3>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cebm.net/">CEBM</a>&nbsp;The Likelihood Ratio (LR) is the likelihood that a given test result would be expected in a patient with the target disorder compared to the likelihood that that same result would be expected in a patient without the target disorder. For example, you hav e a patient with anaemia and a serum ferritin of 60mmol/l and you find in an article that 90 per cent of patients with iron deficiency anaemia have serum ferritins in the same range as your patient (= sensitivity) and that 15 per cent of patients with oth er causes for anaemia have serum ferritins in the same range as your patient (1 &ndash; specificity). This means that your patient&rsquo;s result would be six times as likely (90/15) to be seen in someone with, as opposed to someone without, iron deficiency anaemia, and this is called the LR for a positive test result.</p>
<p>Really, you do not have to worry about calculating them because Bayes calulator will do it for you. However, I suggest you deepen the theoretical and calculation aspects behind the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_ratios_in_diagnostic_testing">Likelihood ratio</a></p>
